# ampkit-project-walker
I have played with metaprogramming ideas and exercises in the past but havent done much with them. This project is an experiment. Sometimes I might re-invent the wheel. Or make some impractical things. Or make things where better solutions and better algorythms exist. But between work IDP, personal fun/growth (outside work), I hope some of this can be useful -- when all is said and done. Maybe I will stumble across tools useful for me personally, and maybe to others too. If not -- it was fun and learned some things. 

## So what is this?
When finished, GUIS which provide different views, visualizations and perspectives on JavaScript projects.
