This project is a metaprogramming experiment. Sometimes I might re-invent the wheel. Or make some impractical things. Or make things where better solutions and better algorithm exist. But reinventing the wheel is a great learning experience. And I can compare as I go with established and tested solutions.

However between work IDP, personal fun/growth (outside work), I hope some of this can be useful, when finished. Maybe I will stumble across tools useful for me personally, and maybe for others too. If not -- it was fun and learned some things. 

## So what is this?
When finished, GUIS which provide different views, visualizations and perspectives on JavaScript projects.
